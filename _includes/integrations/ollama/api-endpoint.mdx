The Weaviate server has to be able to reach the Ollama API endpoint. If Weaviate is running in a container and Ollama is running on the host machine, use the docker `localhost` alias, `host.docker.internal`, to direct Weaviate to your local Ollama instance.

Adjust the API endpoint if your Ollama instance is not running directly on the docker host machine.
