The Weaviate server has to be able to reach the Ollama API endpoint. If Weaviate is running in a Docker container and Ollama is running locally, use `host.docker.internal`, to direct Weaviate to the locally hosted Ollama instance. `host.docker.internal` is a Docker alias that redirects `localhost` in the container to `localhost` on the host machine.

If your Weaviate instance and Ollama instance are hosted in a different way, adjust the API endpoint parameter so it points to your Ollama instance.
