In July we stopped by the Windy City along with our friends from Innovative Solutions and Morningstar to host another roadshow event. Even though this was our first-ever visit to Chicago, our space was packed to the brim with AI enthusiasts asking awesome questions of our presenters and completing our hands-on training in the second half of the day.

Ben Barrett, Head of Technology, and Aisis Julian, Senior Software Engineer at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), shared their journey in building an intelligence engine platform for financial data. They focused on the evolution of the platform, emphasizing corpus management as a critical feature that allows Morningstar to leverage its extensive data across multiple applications. The talk showed how Weaviate has been instrumental in enhancing the precision and flexibility of their generative AI applications.

> Amazingly, our team was able to build this entire pipeline very quickly with Weaviate's Python client and their model provider integration so that we could have a seamless implementation and configuration of embedding models.
