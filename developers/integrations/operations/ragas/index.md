[Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) is a framework to help you evaluate your retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications.

## Ragas and Weaviate 
You'll need to store the `question`, `answer`, `ground_truths`, and `contexts` in a json to load it into Ragas. The Ragas metrics are:
* faithfulness
* answer_relevancy
* context_precision
* context_recall
