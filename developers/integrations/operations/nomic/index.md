[Nomic AI's] Atlas  is a visualization tool for vector embeddings. This describes reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional vectors into 2 or 3 dimensions with algorithms such as t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA. These vectors can then be easily visualized by humans in scatter plots.

## Nomic and Weaviate 
Connect to your Weaviate cluster to visualize the embeddings in your collection.
