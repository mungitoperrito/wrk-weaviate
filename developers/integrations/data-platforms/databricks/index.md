[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) is a data intelligence platform that unifies data, AI and governance on the lakehouse. 


## Databricks and Weaviate

You can easily ingest Spark data structures from Databricks into Weaviate using the Weaviate Spark connector.

Databricks' Foundation Model APIs can be called directly from Weaviate, allowing you to use mdels hosted on the Databricks platform through the `txt2vec-databricks` and `generative-databricks` modules.

Learn more about the connector in the [Weaviate Spark connector documentation](../spark/index.md).

Find out more about the modules in the model providers documentation for [Databricks](../../../weaviate/model-providers/databricks/index.md).
