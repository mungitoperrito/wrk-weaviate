LlamaIndex - some notes

## First Code Examples

:::info
In VS Code you can use `integrations-tabs-code` code snippet to generate the code to show code with tabs.

Just start typing `inttab` and press `Enter`
:::

:::warning
Note, this will also add two imports for `Tabs` and `TabItem`.
You only need it once. Ideally, you should add it just under `---` on line 5.
:::

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">

```python
# Python v4 example goes here
# note there is an empty line before this code snippet,
# without the empty line the code won't render
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py3" label="Python Client v3">

```python
# Python v3 example goes here
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Second Code example - v4 only

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value="py" label="Python Client v4">

```python
# Even if you plan to have one code example, we should always use the tabbed approach.
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Admonitions

:::tip
You can add these pretty admonitions, by typing `doc-inf` press Enter and select from the list of options. i.e. this is `tip`
